<header> Introduction</header>
<p>The term 'technical documentation' refers to different documents with product-related data and information that are used and stored for different purposes. “Different purposes” mean: Product definition and specification, design, manufacturing, quality assurance, product liability, product presentation; description of features, functions and interfaces; intended, safe and correct use; service and repair of a technical product as well as its safe disposal.</p>
    <p>This broader view, in which all documents that are generated during the product life cycle are viewed as part of the technical documentation is certainly justified. After all, the aim is to make available the technical know-how and product history for subsequent users of the information (be they engineers or operators, patent agents or public prosecutors specializing in product liability.</p></section>

<header>What is the purpose of technical documentation?</header>
<p>Technical documentation serves as a guide for the software development process. From gathering the initial software requirements,creating use cases, the software system design and architecture(ERD and class diagrams) and test cases when the software has been developed, the documentation serves as a instruction manual for the software which has been developed through the course of time.</p>

 <ul>
         <li>Technical documentation cuts training cost, as employees are able to achieve their goals without having to seek help from other colleagues</li>
          <li>Employees follow correct procedures, and “know what to do.”
</li>
          <li>It helps to learn new procedures faster and understand them better</li>
          <li>It decreases negative consequences from high turnover</li>
          <li>It allows employees to understand their legal responsibilities
</li>
          <p>You may have a brilliantly planned out project, managed by one of the best project managers in the world, but you still need everybody to be on the same page, and that’s where technical documentation (among other things) comes into play.</p>
          <p>Although, it is considered to be time-wasting, non-revenue and non-value producing tasks that go along with technical development and is often overlooked or downright ignored in smaller companies. When the team is small, and a founder has intimate knowledge of the technical product, that technical know-how is retained. However, once the organization grows, complexity grows, employee turnover happens, etc., that once clear technical feature can suddenly leave people scratching their heads and spending even more valuable time trying to unwind and reverse-engineer the solution.</p>

<header><strong>What is the difference between user documentation and technical documentation?</strong></header>
            <p>Technical documentation is a set of documents used in engineering, manufacturing and utilizing objects of technology such as buildings, products, software, and hardware. In a broader perspective, technical documentation encompasses all the documents created during the product life cycle.</p>
          <p>The primary goal of technical documentation is to ensure that the user can completely understand the technology this documentation describes. Normally, a person in charge of creating such documentation is a technical writer or an employee with a suitable technical background. The main task of such person is to contribute to the primary goal of technical documentation and turn a formalized doc understandable for technicians only into a user-friendly story that improves the knowledge of a particular technology or, to put it differently, converts it into user documentation.</p>

 <p>It decreases your customer tickets. Customers can look for answers to their queries directly in the online document. It prevents customers from reaching out to your support staff for help for every little or trivial issues.</p>
            <p> Your team of developers gets a central knowledge bank to refer to while troubleshooting problems.</p>
            <p>A technical document is advantageous for your support teams as well. Every time they have to address customer concerns, all they need to do is, refer to the document to get information and convey the same to customers. This reduces call hold time, making your customers happy and satisfied.</p>
            <p>You can maintain your software product by going through the information provided in the document.</p>
