###DOM
 DOM stands for Document Object Model and is an abstraction of a structured text.
 The DOM is simply called HTML DOM. Elements of HTML become nodes in the DOM.
 The HTML DOM provides an interface (API) to traverse and modify the nodes. It contains methods like getElementById or removeChild.
 whenever we want to dynamicly change the content of the web page, we modify the DOM

 ###Virtual DOM
 The Virtual DOM is an abstraction of the HTML DOM.
 It is lightweight and detached from the browser-specific implementation details.
 Three attributes of the virtual DOM that don’t appear in “real” DOM - key, ref and dangerouslySetInnerHTML
