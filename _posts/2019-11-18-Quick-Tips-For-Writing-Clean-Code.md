Constants or enum.
Intermediate variables etc.

### Apology Comment
Donâ€™t ever write such apologetic comments. Always fix it before you push the code, or you can also add a TODO marker comment.

### Warning Comment
which are alarming or giving warning signals then go ahead and refactor the code and make it clean so that next time you or someone else visits the code, he should not be looking at those warning comments.
