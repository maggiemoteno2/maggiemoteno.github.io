### What is Algorithms?
Data Structures are the programmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently. Almost every enterprise application uses various types of data structures in one or the other way. 

### Why to Learn Data Structure and Algorithms?
-Data Search − Consider an inventory of 1 million(106) items of a store. If the application is to search an -item, it has to search an item in 1 million(106) items every time slowing down the search. As data grows, search will become slower.

-Processor speed − Processor speed although being very high, falls limited if the data grows to billion records.

-Multiple requests − As thousands of users can search data simultaneously on a web server, even the fast server fails while searching the data.

### Applications of Data Structure and Algorithms
-Search − Algorithm to search an item in a data structure.

-Sort − Algorithm to sort items in a certain order.

-Insert − Algorithm to insert item in a data structure.

-Update − Algorithm to update an existing item in a data structure.

-Delete − Algorithm to delete an existing item from a data structure.

### The following computer problems can be solved using Data Structures −
-Fibonacci number series

-Knapsack problem

-Tower of Hanoi

-All pair shortest path by Floyd-Warshall

-Shortest path by Dijkstra

-Project scheduling

### The foundation terms of a data structure.

-Interface − Each data structure has an interface. Interface represents the set of operations that a data structure supports. An interface only provides the list of supported operations, type of parameters they can accept and return type of these operations.

-Implementation − Implementation provides the internal representation of a data structure. Implementation also provides the definition of the algorithms used in the operations of the data structure.
