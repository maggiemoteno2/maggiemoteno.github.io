###What are Hooks?
Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let you use React without classes.

###State Hook
 We call it inside a function component to add some local state to it. 
 You can call this function from an event handler or somewhere else. It’s similar to this.setState in a class, except it doesn’t merge the old and new state together. 
 The only argument to useState is the initial state.

 ###Effect Hook
  Adds the ability to perform side effects from a function component. It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in React classes, but unified into a single API.

  ###Rules of Hooks
-Only call Hooks at the top level. Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
-Only call Hooks from React function components. Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. (There is just one other valid place to call Hooks — your own custom Hooks.)
