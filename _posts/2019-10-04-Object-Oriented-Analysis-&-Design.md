### What is Object-Oriented Analysis?
Object–Oriented Analysis (OOA) is the procedure of identifying software engineering requirements and developing software specifications in terms of a software system’s object model, which comprises of interacting objects.

The main difference between object-oriented analysis and other forms of analysis is that in object-oriented approach, requirements are organized around objects, which integrate both data and functions.

### The primary tasks in object-oriented analysis
-Identifying objects

-Organizing the objects by creating object model diagram

-Defining the internals of the objects, or object attributes

-Defining the behavior of the objects, i.e., object actions

-Describing how the objects interact

### The implementation details generally include −
-Restructuring the class data (if necessary),

-Implementation of methods, i.e., internal data structures and algorithms,

-Implementation of control, and

-Implementation of associations.

### The important features of object–oriented programming are −
-Bottom–up approach in program design

-Programs organized around objects, grouped in classes

-Focus on data with methods to operate upon object’s data

-Interaction between objects through functions

-Reusability of design through creation of new classes by adding features to existing classes
