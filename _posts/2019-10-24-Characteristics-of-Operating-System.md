### Characteristics of Operating System
Memory Management − Keeps track of the primary memory, i.e. what part of it is in use by whom, what part is not in use, etc. and allocates the memory when a process or program requests it.

Processor Management − Allocates the processor (CPU) to a process and deallocates the processor when it is no longer required.

Device Management − Keeps track of all the devices. This is also called I/O controller that decides which process gets the device, when, and for how much time.

File Management − Allocates and de-allocates the resources and decides who gets the resources.

Security − Prevents unauthorized access to programs and data by means of passwords and other similar techniques.

Job Accounting − Keeps track of time and resources used by various jobs and/or users.

Control Over System Performance − Records delays between the request for a service and from the system.

Interaction with the Operators − Interaction may take place via the console of the computer in the form of instructions. The Operating System acknowledges the same, does the corresponding action, and informs the operation by a display screen.

Error-detecting Aids − Production of dumps, traces, error messages, and other debugging and error-detecting methods.

Coordination Between Other Software and Users − Coordination and assignment of compilers, interpreters, assemblers, and other software to the various users of the computer systems.

### Similarities between Internet and Intranet
Intranet uses the internet protocols such as TCP/IP and FTP.

Intranet sites are accessible via the web browser in a similar way as websites in the internet. However, only members of Intranet network can access intranet hosted sites.

In Intranet, own instant messengers can be used as similar to yahoo messenger/gtalk over the internet.

### Differences between Internet and Intranet
Internet is general to PCs all over the world whereas Intranet is specific to few PCs.

Internet provides a wider and better access to websites to a large population, whereas Intranet is restricted.

Internet is not as safe as Intranet. Intranet can be safely privatized as per the need.
