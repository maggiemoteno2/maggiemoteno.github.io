### Panels
A panel in bootstrap is a bordered box with some padding around its content. To create a basic panel,we use .panel class to the <div> element, and content inside the panel has a .panel-body class.

### Panels with Contextual Classes
To color the panel for particular context we can use contextual classes as
.panel-default
.panel-primary
.panel-success
.panel-info
.panel-warning
.panel-danger
