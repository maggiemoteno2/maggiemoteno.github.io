### What is Data structures?
Data Structure is a systematic way to organize data in order to use it efficiently. Following terms are the foundation terms of a data structure.

-Interface − Each data structure has an interface. Interface represents the set of operations that a data structure supports. An interface only provides the list of supported operations, type of parameters they can accept and return type of these operations.

-Implementation − Implementation provides the internal representation of a data structure. Implementation also provides the definition of the algorithms used in the operations of the data structure.

### Characteristics of a Data Structure
-Correctness − Data structure implementation should implement its interface correctly.

-Time Complexity − Running time or the execution time of operations of data structure must be as small as possible.

-Space Complexity − Memory usage of a data structure operation should be as little as possible.

### Need for Data Structure
-Data Search − Consider an inventory of 1 million(106) items of a store. If the application is to search an item, it has to search an item in 1 million(106) items every time slowing down the search. As data grows, search will become slower.

-Processor speed − Processor speed although being very high, falls limited if the data grows to billion records.

-Multiple requests − As thousands of users can search data simultaneously on a web server, even the fast server fails while searching the data.
