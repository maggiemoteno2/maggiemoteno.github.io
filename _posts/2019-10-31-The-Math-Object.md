### The Math Object
The math object provides you properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions. Unlike other global objects, Math is not a constructor. All the properties and methods of Math are static and can be called by using Math as an object without creating it.

Thus, you refer to the constant pi as Math.PI and you call the sine function as Math.sin(x), where x is the method's argument.

### Math Methods
1	abs()
Returns the absolute value of a number.

2	acos()
Returns the arccosine (in radians) of a number.

3	asin()
Returns the arcsine (in radians) of a number.

4	atan()
Returns the arctangent (in radians) of a number.

5	atan2()
Returns the arctangent of the quotient of its arguments.

6	ceil()
Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a number.

7	cos()
Returns the cosine of a number.

8	exp()
Returns EN, where N is the argument, and E is Euler's constant, the base of the natural logarithm.

9	floor()
Returns the largest integer less than or equal to a number.

10	log()
Returns the natural logarithm (base E) of a number.

11	max()
Returns the largest of zero or more numbers.

12	min()
Returns the smallest of zero or more numbers.

13	pow()
Returns base to the exponent power, that is, base exponent.

14	random()
Returns a pseudo-random number between 0 and 1.

15	round()
Returns the value of a number rounded to the nearest integer.

16	sin()
Returns the sine of a number.

17	sqrt()
Returns the square root of a number.

18	tan()
Returns the tangent of a number.

19	toSource()
Returns the string "Math".
