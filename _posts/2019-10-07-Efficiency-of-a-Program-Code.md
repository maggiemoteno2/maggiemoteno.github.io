### Efficiency of a Program Code
The efficiency of a programming code is directly proportional to the algorithmic efficiency and the execution speed. Good efficiency ensures higher performance.

The factors that affect the efficiency of a program includes −

The speed of the machine
Compiler speed
Operating system
Choosing right Programming language
The way of data in a program is organized
Algorithm used to solve the problem
The efficiency of a programming language can be improved by performing the following tasks −

By removing unnecessary code or the code that goes to redundant processing.

By making use of optimal memory and nonvolatile storage

By making the use of reusable components wherever applicable.

By making the use of error & exception handling at all layers of program.

By creating programming code that ensures data integrity and consistency.

By developing the program code that's compliant with the design logic and flow.

An efficient programming code can reduce resource consumption and completion time as much as possible with minimum risk to the operating environment.
