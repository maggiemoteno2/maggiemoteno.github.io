### Filter
The filter function expects a true or false value to determine if the element should or should not be included in the result collection. 
Basically, if the callback expression is true, the filter function will include the element in the result collection. Otherwise, it will not.

### Imperative approach

An imperative way to do it with Javascript is to:
-create an empty vector evenNumbers

-iterate over the numbers vector

-push the even numbers to the evenNumbers vector

### Map
The map method transforms a collection by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new collection from the returned values.

### Reduced
The idea of reduce is to receive a function and a collection, and return a value created by combining the items.
