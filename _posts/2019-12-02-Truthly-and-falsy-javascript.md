### Truthly 
a truthy value is a value that is considered true when encountered in a Boolean context. All values are truthy unless they are defined as falsy (i.e., except for false, 0, 0n, "", null, undefined, and NaN).

### falsy 
A falsy value is a value that is considered false when encountered in a Boolean context.

JavaScript uses Type Conversion to coerce any value to a Boolean in contexts that require it, such as conditionals and loops.


### Boolean
In computer science, a Boolean is a logical data type that can have only the values true or false. For example, in JavaScript, Boolean conditionals are often used to decide which sections of code to execute (such as in if statements) or repeat (such as in for loops).
