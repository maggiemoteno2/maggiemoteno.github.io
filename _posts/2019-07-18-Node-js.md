###What is Node js?

Node.js is a server-side platform built on Google Chrome's JavaScript Engine
Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux.

Node.js also provides a rich library of various JavaScript modules which simplifies the development of web applications using Node.js to a great extent.



###Features of Node.js
Asynchronous and Event Driven
All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking. It essentially means a Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data.

Very Fast 
Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast in code execution

Single Threaded but Highly Scalable 
 Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests.

 ###Where to Use Node.js?
 I/O bound Applications
Data Streaming Applications
Data Intensive Real-time Applications (DIRT)
JSON APIs based Applications
Single Page Applications
