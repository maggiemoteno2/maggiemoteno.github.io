###What is React?
 is open-source JavaScript library which is used for building user interfaces specifically for single page applications.
 React makes user interfaces very easy to build by cutting each page into pieces. We call these pieces components.


 ###What is a React component?
 A React component is a bit of code that represents a piece of the page
 Each component is a JavaScript function that returns a piece of code that represents a piece of a web page.

 ###Class Components
 Class components must have a function called render() The render function returns the JSX of the component. 
 Class components can store information about their current situation. This information is called state, which is stored in a JavaScript object.
 A constructor method of a React component always needs to call super(props) before anything else.

###The Bad Thing About setState
setState is bad because it doesn’t do stuff right away. React waits a bit to see if there are more changes to make, then it does the state changes.

That means you don’t know for sure what your state will be when you call setState.
