### What is Scoping?

Scope refers to the visibility of variables. In other words, which parts of your program can see or use it.
It is very useful to be able to limit a variable's scope to a single function. the variable wil have a limited scope.
the function can't affect the main program in unexpected ways,

### Difference between local and global scope

A local variable, however, has a limited scope: it exists only within the block that it is declared in. 
Once that block ends, the variable is destroyed and its values lost.
A local variable can even exist multiple times simultaneously, if its block is entered again before it's exited.
A local variable with the same name as another in-scope variable will have precedence over the outer variable.

A global variable is a variable which is accessible in multiple scopes.all variables in a script are global. 
Global variables are useful for values that are relatively constant, or that many functions in the script must access, such as a session id.
