## Strings and variables
What is a String and a Variable?. 
A String is connected sequence of symbols in a form of numbers or words that is being carried by a variable,
e.g. var myName = ("Njabulo"); or var randomNumbers = ("1, 45, 5, 67, 43, 8, 3");.
In this case what is inside the brackets is considered as a "String".
A Variable is a symbol or names that stand for a certain value for,e.g. var X = 34;,
So here our Variable is X,of which X stands for the value of 34 and if I want to call out 34 I would simple console.log(X) and my answer would simply be 34.
And Variables also help incase were by we want to call out a particular sentence time and time again,we can simply assign it to anything even the name sentence can be its variable.
