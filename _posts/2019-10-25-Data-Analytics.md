### What is Data Analytics?

Data or information is in raw format. The increase in size of the data has lead to a rise in need for carrying out inspection, data cleaning, transformation as well as data modeling to gain insights from the data in order to derive conclusions for better decision making process. This process is known as data analysis.

### Data Analysis vs Data Reporting

The analysis is an interactive process of a person tackling a problem, finding the data required to get an answer, analyzing that data, and interpreting the results in order to provide a recommendation for action.

### Difference between Data Analysis and Data Reporting

-A report will show the user what had happened in the past to avoid inferences and help to get a feel for the data while analysis provides answers to any question or issue. An analysis process takes any steps needed to get the answers to those questions.

-Reporting just provides the data that is asked for while analysis provides the information or the answer that is needed actually.
We perform the reporting in a standardized way, but we can customize the analysis. There are fixed standard formats for reporting while we perform the analysis as per the requirement; we customize it as needed.

-We can perform reporting using a tool and it generally does not involve any person in the analysis. Whereas, a person is there for doing analysis and leading the complete analysis process.

-Reporting is inflexible while analysis is flexible. Reporting provides no or limited context about whatâ€™s happening in the data and hence is inflexible while analysis emphasizes data points that are significant, unique, or special, and it explains why they are important to the business.
