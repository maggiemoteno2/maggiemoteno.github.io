###pomodoro Techique
 Emails, texts, phone calls and even snack breaks prevent us from focusing on and effectively executing  a single task at a time. For decades.

Pomodoro is a way to help us manage our time more efficiently
by having breaks in between small sessions of focused work time which keeps our minds focused and fresh.

You work for 25 minutes and then you take a five minutes break,When you have finished four sessions you take 15-20 minutes break.
