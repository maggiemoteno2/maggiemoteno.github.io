### Introduction 
It's never been easy to  be a programmer, beginner to be specific you have to learn everything at once, teach yourself how to focus, how to work under pressure and mostly to do things correctly, Computer programming  is fun and mind-blowing the reason I love computer programming is that you get a chance to design and build programs that will help the world, it's less like being a superhero 

### What i usually faced this week
It's always best to learn how to learn, learn how your mind works it's not easy to remember Everything that you did but if you know how your mind operates there's nothing to stress about. practice is the most powerful tool that one can use to master programming(code), reading blogs, and watching tutorials.

It will never be easy, sometimes you will feel like giving up, people will tell you that you not good enough but don't listen to them, Always think about what you want and how to get it to teach yourself how to solve problems with code.

### Today's kata
Oh no! Timmy's evalObject function doesn't work. He uses Switch/Cases to evaluate the given properties of an object, can you fix timmy's function?

### solution 
function evalObject(value){
  var result = 0;
  switch(value.operation){
    case'+': 
      return result = value.a + value.b;
      break;
    case'-': 
      return result = value.a - value.b;
      break;
    case'/': 
      return result = value.a / value.b;
      break;
    case'*': return result = value.a * value.b;
      break;
    case'%': return result = value.a % value.b;
      break;
    case'^': return result = Math.pow(value.a, value.b);
      break
  }
  return result;
}
