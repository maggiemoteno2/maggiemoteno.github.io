### What is Babel?

Babel is a JavaScript compiler
Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Here are the main things Babel can do for you:

-Transform syntax

-Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment 

-Source code transformations (codemods)

### ES2015 and beyond
Babel has support for the latest version of JavaScript through syntax transformers.

### JSX and React
Babel can convert JSX syntax! 

### Pluggable
Babel is built out of plugins. Compose your own transformation pipeline using existing plugins or write your own. Easily use a set of plugins by using or creating

### Spec Compliant
Babel tries to stay true to the ECMAScript standard, as much as reasonably possible. It may also have specific options to be more spec compliant as a tradeoff to performance.

### Compact
Babel tries using the least amount of code possible with no dependence on a bulky runtime.

This may be difficult to do in cases, and there are "loose" options for specific transforms that may tradeoff spec compliancy for readability, file size, and speed.
