# My journey
"Code is like humor when you have to explain it, its bad"
I always wondered how people created cool fun games, websites, and blogs, 
for a week The Coding Ground taught me that  "Simplicity is the soul of efficiency".
"it always seems impossible until its done".

So far the whole week was fantastic I had a lot to learn and there was a lot of things that I experimented things like hyper text markup language which in short is HTML I also learned CSS and four rules of simple design. To be honest, at first, I was intimidated but I managed to overcome my intimidation. I'm looking forward to being part of the team.
