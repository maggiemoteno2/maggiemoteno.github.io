### What is es6?

 Is a scripting language specification standardized by ECMAScript International. 
 It is used by applications to enable client-side scripting.
  Languages like JavaScript, Jscript and ActionScript are governed by this specificatio.


###How was Javascript created?
JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape Communications. 
It was inspired by Java, Scheme and Self. Netscape, for a time, made the best browser in the world and enjoyed market dominance. 
Sun began development of Java in 1990 in an attempt to write a language for “smart appliances”

  ### What is the difference between es6 and Javascript?
ES6 is short-hand for EcmaScript 6, which is a deprecated name for the EcmaScript 2015 language specification.
ES2015 is the 6th version of EcmaScript, thus why it was previously referred to as ES6.
It was eventually abandoned and ES3.1 became ES5, 
which is the JavaScript version used in the "HTML5" world.
