### Challenge
I had to write a program that adds intergers and it should always be greater than 0,yesterday I wrote two tests about algorithms patterns.The first test was okay I enjoyed it but the second test was a bit tricky.

### what i have learnt from the challenge
I have learnt that there's always a solution to each and every problem it just needs one to think through about the challenge,draw mindmaps.
