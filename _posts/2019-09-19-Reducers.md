###Reducer
The reducer is a pure function that takes the previous state and an action, and returns the next state.
Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store. Remember that actions only describe what happened, but don't describe how the application's state changes.
It's called a reducer because it's the type of function you would pass to Array.prototype.reduce(reducer, ?initialValue).


###Things you should never do inside a reducer
-Mutate its arguments;
-Perform side effects like API calls and routing transitions;
-Call non-pure functions;
