### Introduction
Today's kata is School paper 

### Instructions
Your classmates asked you to copy some paperwork for them. You know that there are 'n' classmates and the paperwork has 'm' pages.

Your task is to calculate how many blank pages do you need.

### Solution
`function paperWork(n, m) {
  if(n<0 || m<0){
    return 0
  }else{
    
  return n*m
  }
}`
I have a function called paperWork which takes two arguments where n is the classmate and m is the number of pages.I wrote if statement,gave it a condition that if classmate is less than zero which is n or if my pages are less than zero it should return me zero  which means my classmates needs zero pages to copy some paperWork.

if the condition failed then just return me classmate multiply by number of pages then i get the pages my class mates needs to copy paper Work


### conclusion
I learnt how to use operators, the difference between &&(and) operator and ||(or) operator
