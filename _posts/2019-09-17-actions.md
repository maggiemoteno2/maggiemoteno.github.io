###What are actions?
Actions are the only source of information for the store as per Redux official documentation. It carries a payload of information from your application to store.Actions are plain JavaScript object that must have a type attribute to indicate the type of action performed.

###Difference between action and action creater
An action is like a message that we send to our central Redux store. It can literally be anything. But ideally we want to stick to an agreed-upon pattern.
Action Creator
As you might expect, an action creator is a function that creates and returns an action.
