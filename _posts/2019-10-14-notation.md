### What is a notation?
Is a way to write arithmetic expression 

-Infix Notation

-Prefix (Polish) Notation

-Postfix (Reverse-Polish) Notation

### Infix Notation
where operators are used in-between operands. It is easy for us humans to read, write, and speak in infix notation but the same does not go well with computing devices. An algorithm to process infix notation could be difficult and costly in terms of time and space consumption.

### Prefix Notation
the operator is postfixed to the operands i.e., the operator is written after the operands. For example, ab+. This is equivalent to its infix notation a + b.
