        <p>Hello there, my name is Maggie,the future <strong>Robot Wrangler</strong>,i'm so excited for the coming human robots generation

        I fell inlove with programming at the age of 17,when i attended my first coding classes
        ,i joined the programme late but i managed to be the best coder of the year.i always dreamt of becomimg a <strong>nuclear scientist</strong> not because i loved it but because of the fancy big word.
